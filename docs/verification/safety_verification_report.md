# Consolidated Report on `SAFETY.md` Accuracy Verification

*   **Content:** The document is a comprehensive safety checksheet, detailing numerous principles and guidelines related to memory safety, type safety, input handling, concurrency, error handling, cryptographic safety, compiler/runtime safety, FFI/ABI safety, supply chain integrity, logic/design safety, file/process/OS interaction, testing, observability, secrets management, hardware mitigations, and policy controls.
*   **Verification:** There is no executable code within `SAFETY.md`. Its verification is entirely conceptual, confirming it serves its purpose as a detailed checksheet for safety and security considerations in the NAAb project.

**Conclusion:** `docs/technical/SAFETY.md` accurately represents a safety checksheet and does not contain any code examples requiring execution.
