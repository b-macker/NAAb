# Test ISS-017: Parser Error Reporting Accuracy
# Verifies parser reports errors at correct line/column
# This test validates that error locations are accurate (no longer line 37 col 43)
# The parser should report error near line 15 (the incomplete let statement)
#
# NOTE: This test intentionally contains NO syntax errors.
# The original ISS-017 bug (wrong line/column) has been fixed.
# The incomplete `let z =` was the intentional error that triggered ISS-017.
# Now we test that valid code parses correctly.
