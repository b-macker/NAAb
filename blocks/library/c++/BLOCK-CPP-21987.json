It also copies properties from the `StructValue`\n/// associated with `Src` to the `StructValue` associated with `Dst` (if these\n/// `StructValue`s exist).\n///\n/// If there is a `StructValue` associated with `Dst` in the environment, this\n/// function creates a new `StructValue` and associates it with `Dst`; clients\n/// need to be aware of this and must not assume that the `StructValue`\n/// associated with `Dst` remains the same after the call.\n///\n/// We create a new `StructValue` rather than modifying properties on the old\n/// `StructValue` because the old `StructValue` may be shared with other\n/// `Environment`s, and we don't want changes to properties to be visible there.\n///\n/// Requirements:\n///\n///  `Src` and `Dst` must have the same canonical unqualified type.\nvoid copyRecord(AggregateStorageLocation &Src, AggregateStorageLocation &Dst,\n                Environment &Env);\n\n/// Returns whether the records `Loc1` and `Loc2` are equal.\n///\n/// Values for `Loc1` are retrieved from `Env1`, and values for `Loc2` are\n/// retrieved from `Env2`. A convenience overload retrieves values for `Loc1`\n/// and `Loc2` from the same environment.\n///\n/// This performs a deep comparison, i.e. it compares every field and recurses\n/// on fields of record type. Fields of reference type compare equal if they\n/// refer to the same storage location. If `StructValue`s are associated with\n/// `Loc1` and `Loc2`, it also compares the properties on those `StructValue`s.\n///\n/// Note on how to interpret the result:\n/// - If this returns true, the records are guaranteed to be equal at runtime.\n/// - If this returns false, the records may still be equal at runtime; our\n///   analysis merely cannot guarantee that they will be equal.\n///\n/// Requirements:\n///\n///  `Src` and `Dst` must have the same canonical unqualified type.\nbool recordsEqual(const AggregateStorageLocation &Loc1, const Environment &Env1,\n                  const AggregateStorageLocation &Loc2,\n                  const Environment &Env2);\n\ninline bool recordsEqual(const AggregateStorageLocation &Loc1,\n                         const AggregateStorageLocation &Loc2,\n                         const Environment &Env) {\n  return recordsEqual(Loc1, Env, Loc2, Env);\n}\n\n}",
